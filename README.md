# Introduction
Players need to pick up items to achieve a specified score (5 scores) in a given time to win the game while dodging enemies attacks. At the end of a round, players can inherit the items to continue the game.
The enemy will use bullets to attack the player actively, and the player can move to avoid them.
Props are items, one worth one score. Props are re-generated after being picked up, and players can use them to gain buffs.
