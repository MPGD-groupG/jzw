Players need to pick up items to achieve a specified score (5 scores) in a given time to win the game while dodging enemies attacks.<br>
The enemy will use bullets to attack the player actively, and the player can move to avoid them.<br>
Props are items, one worth one score. Props are re-generated after being picked up, and players can use them to gain buffs. Props can be carried over to the next round of play.<br>
